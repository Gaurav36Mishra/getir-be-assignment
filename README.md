 Need to create a RESTful API with a single endpoint that fetches the data in the  provided MongoDB collection and return the results in the requested format. 
 
 * Node.js
 * Express
 
 The simplest way to run this locally is to create a `.env` file and it should contain following two things as below
 `DB_CONNECTION = 'your mongodb url'`
 `PORT = port number that you want to listen to run this project`

 # Node JS Server

 First install the packages
 `npm install`

 Run all test
 `npm test`
